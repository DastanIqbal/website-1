      <description>Most reptiles actively thermoregulate by using behavioral adjustments to achieve and maintain their preferred body temperature. However, the pursuit of a thermal optima is accompanied by a trade–off with potential water loss. likewise, there are a wide range of other life–history traits that governed behavioral thermoregulation, such as food consumption. Hence, thermoregulatory behavior should be a trade–off among all these physiological activities. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the relationship between behavioral thermoregulation and water balance can be modulated by food consumption in the lizard Tropidurus catalanensis.</description>
