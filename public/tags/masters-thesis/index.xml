      <description>Theoretical models predict that lizards after meal consumption must maintain high and constant body temperatures by making behavioral adjustments. Still, behavioral thermoregulation can be affected by other physiological factors such as the hydration state, body condition or can conflict with the locomotor activity of animals. Hence, the thermoregulatory behavior of a lizard should be the result of interactions among all these physiological and ecological processes. In this study we aimed to investigate the role of food intake and the hydration state on behavioral thermoregulation and locomotor activity in the tropidurid lizard Tropidurus catalanensis.</description>
