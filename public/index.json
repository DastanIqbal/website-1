I was hired as an Intern to help them with a variety of activities, including lizard gathering, thermal tolerance experiments, data processing and statistical analyses.\nThis research project aims to use genome-wide-association studies to identify genetic loci underlying variation in the thermal physiology of the slender anole lizard Anolis apletophallus (see pictures below), and to track changes in the frequencies of these loci in populations transplanted to islands in the Panama Canal. These islands vary in their thermal landscapes such that some are much warmer than the mainland whereas others are similar in temperature to the mainland. To date, they have transplanted 700 individuals to 10 islands in Gatun Lake and this season we are transplanting lizards into another six islands. By conducting mark-recapture on the experimental islands, we will link phenotypic selection with genetic changes in real time, using the recently sequenced genome of A. apletophallus to explore the functional roles of specific genes under selection. After several generations of evolution, this project will use population pedigrees to estimate the genetic correlations and heritabilities underlying traits involved in thermal adaptation and model the long-term evolutionary response of the slender anole to climate change.\nIt has been a great experince to be able to work with such a good team!\nOne of the coolest part of this project is the transplanting experiments. Every time we have to go to the islands we take a 20 min ferry trip to Barro Colorado Island (BCI), in which STRI has a research station and provides us with a boat to do our work. Below you can see some pictures of BCI (and John David Curlis [JDC] and me on the boat).\n    As mentioned above, we are conducting thermal tolerance experiments with the lizards. That is, we are interested in determining the preferred body temperature, but also the upper and lower thermal voluntary limits of the lizards. Furthermore, we are quantifying dewlap, dorsal and ventral reflectance of the lizard since these are traits that can change over the time as they are introduced in novel environments (i.e., islands). Below I show some pictures of thermal gradients (upper left), JDC and Cleo Falvey measuring dewlap reflectance (upper right), me calculating the area of the dewlap\u0026rsquo;s yellow patch of an individual (lower left) and lizard clay models to determine predation rates on mainland as well as on islands (lower right).\n   Here are a couple of pictures of me holding two of the most interesting lizards we have found during field work. On the left I have a Bridled Anole Anolis frenatus and on the right I have a Smooth Helmeted Iguana Corytophanes cristatus.\n   And this is the lizard team for this season (2019) in Gamboa!\n","date":1565827200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565827200,"objectID":"ea301c274e836e489d0b56c93b5c19d1","permalink":"/2019/08/15/internship-at-stri-panama/","publishdate":"2019-08-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2019/08/15/internship-at-stri-panama/","section":"post","summary":"I am currently working at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute - Panama (STRI) on a really interesting long-term project lead by Mike Logan, Christian Cox and Owen McMillan.

For organisms that possess specialized structures that function as weapons, fighting performance depends strongly on the ability of these structures to inflict injuries on rival combatants. However, aggressive interactions between animals are potentially costly because of the energy required to fight and the risk of injury or death. Because of the inherent costs associated with escalating aggressive interactions, many animals resolve disputes without combat by signaling their own fighting potential and comparing this with the potential of their opponent.\nTheory predicts that animals should employ honest signals of resource holding potential during competitive interactions unless the cost of assessing the honesty of a signal is relatively great and the cost of producing a deceptive signal is relatively small. Signals of weaponry or potential strength should be physically or physiologically linked to competitive ability such that poor competitors cannot produce a signal equivalent to that of a good competitor. Not surprisingly, few clear examples of dishonest signals of fighting potential exist. Because dishonest signals are designed to go unnoticed, their detection is difficult for researchers and conspecifics alike. Assessing the honesty of signals requires (1) analyses of the relationship between the visual signal and fighting capacity and (2) measures of the physical performance of the displayed weaponry.\nDoctoral student Zack Graham is highly interested in the above topic and is conducting several experiments on the Crayfish Faxonius virilis with my help at Michael Angilletta\u0026rsquo;s lab. One of the objectives of his work is to test whether claw size of the Crayfish is a reliable signal of strength. You can see below an interesting video of what we are doing right now.

This research project is based on the synthesis of the color-mediated thermoregulation hypothesis which states that dark individuals (i.e. lower skin reflectance) are at an advantage under conditions of low temperature since they warm up faster than light individuals at a given level of solar radiation. Although skin color is an important trait in the thermal biology of ectotherms, it has been explored mostly in insects and some reptiles of temperate zones. The aim of this project is to determine whether the dorsal color changes among species of tropidurid lizards in response of physic and physiological variables such as mean annual temperature, global solar radiation and heating/cooling rates. Here, we will therefore examine the color-mediated thermoregulation hypothesis in a evolutionary context in heliothermic lizards, using standard and phylogenetically corrected analyses. We expect the lizards with low skin reflectance to occur at localities with relatively low mean annual temperature and solar radiation, conversely, lizards with high skin reflectance to occur at localities with relatively high mean annual temperature and solar radiation.\n","date":1537405200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538621145,"objectID":"a84c67c3f57ba0133acf80f3cc9c6819","permalink":"/project/color/","publishdate":"2018-09-19T20:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/color/","section":"project","summary":"Color-mediated thermoregulation hypothesis","tags":[],"title":"What drives the evolution of dorsal coloration in tropidurid lizards?","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Theoretical models predict that lizards after meal consumption must maintain high and constant body temperatures by making behavioral adjustments. Still, behavioral thermoregulation can be affected by other physiological factors such as the hydration state, body condition or can conflict with the locomotor activity of animals. Hence, the thermoregulatory behavior of a lizard should be the result of interactions among all these physiological and ecological processes. In this study we aimed to investigate the role of food intake and the hydration state on behavioral thermoregulation and locomotor activity in the tropidurid lizard Tropidurus catalanensis. We hypothesized that food intake can influence behavioral thermoregulation via an interaction with the hydration state. We also hypothesized that lizards should endeavor to spend as little time as possible to reach their preferred body temperatures in order to defend other physiological and/or ecological functions. We combined field work and laboratory experiments in order to measure preferred environmental temperatures and total traveled distances of the lizards in fed and fasted states and with variable hydration state. Our results showed that food consumption and body condition of the lizards were the most important predictors of their preferred environmental temperatures. In contrast, either plasma osmolality by itself, or the interaction between plasma osmolality and food consumption did not have an important effect on the thermal preferences of lizards. Also, we found that the total traveled distances of lizards were unaffected by any of the predictors tested. We provided novel insights on the extent to which the interaction between meal consumption and the hydration state can influence behavioral thermoregulation and locomotor activity in a species of lizard that escapes the pattern of species commonly studied (e.g., desert reptiles). Our findings should be important to understand thermo–hydroregulation and decision making in lizards.\n","date":1537398120,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538621145,"objectID":"73203ae79f71d06aefc9f5f3267ddf27","permalink":"/project/masters-project/","publishdate":"2018-09-19T18:02:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/masters-project/","section":"project","summary":"Effects of food intake and the hydration state on behavioral thermoregulation and locomotor activity in the tropidurid lizard *Tropidurus catalanensis*","tags":["Master's thesis"],"title":"Master's thesis","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1536469200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538621145,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"t","type":"docs"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.
