Whether the color of an animal plays a significant role in thermoregulation has been a persistent question in studies of thermal biology of ectotherms. This research project is based on the synthesis of the color-mediated thermoregulation hypothesis which states that dark individuals (i.e. lower skin reflectance) are at an advantage under conditions of low temperature since they warm up faster than light individuals at a given level of solar radiation. Although skin color is an important trait in the thermal biology of ectotherms, it has been explored mostly in insects and some reptiles of temperate zones. The aim of this project is to test the hypothesis that the dorsal color and climate variables such as mean annual temperature and global solar radiation (of the sample localities) are related across species of tropidurid lizards. Here, we will therefore examine the color-mediated thermoregulation hypothesis in a evolutionary context in heliothermic lizard species, using standard and phylogenetically corrected analyses. We expect that lizards with low skin reflectance occur at localities with relatively low mean annual temperature and solar radiation, conversely, lizards with high skin reflectance occur at localities with relatively high mean annual temperature and solar radiation.
