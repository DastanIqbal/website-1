Theoretical models predict that lizards after meal consumption must maintain high and constant body temperatures by making behavioral adjustments. Still, behavioral thermoregulation can be affected by other physiological factors such as the hydration state, body condition or can conflict with the locomotor activity of animals. Hence, the thermoregulatory behavior of a lizard should be the result of interactions among all these physiological and ecological processes. In this study we aimed to investigate the role of food intake and the hydration state on behavioral thermoregulation and locomotor activity in the tropidurid lizard Tropidurus catalanensis. We hypothesized that food intake can influence behavioral thermoregulation via an interaction with the hydration state. We also hypothesized that lizards should endeavor to spend as little time as possible to reach their preferred body temperatures in order to defend other physiological and/or ecological functions. We combined field work and laboratory experiments in order to measure preferred environmental temperatures and total traveled distances of the lizards in fed and fasted states and with variable hydration state. Our results showed that food consumption and body condition of the lizards were the most important predictors of their preferred environmental temperatures. In contrast, either plasma osmolality by itself, or the interaction between plasma osmolality and food consumption did not have an important effect on the thermal preferences of lizards. Also, we found that the total traveled distances of lizards were unaffected by any of the predictors tested. We provided novel insights on the extent to which the interaction between meal consumption and the hydration state can influence behavioral thermoregulation and locomotor activity in a species of lizard that escapes the pattern of species commonly studied (e.g., desert reptiles). Our findings should be important to understand thermoâ€“hydroregulation and decision making in lizards.
