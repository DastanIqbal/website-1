Theoretical models predict that lizards after meal consumption must maintain high and constant body temperatures by making behavioral adjustments. Still, food intake probably affects other physiological factors such as water balance and the locomotor performance of animals. Hence, the actual behavior of an animal should be the result of interactions among all these physiological and ecological activities. Here we aimed to investigate the role of food intake on behavioral thermoregulation and water balance in the tropidurid lizard *Tropidurus catalanensis*. Simultaneously, we tested whether the lizards incur a cost of missed opportunity since food consumption sometimes compromises the locomotor performance of animals. We hypothesized that food intake drives the lizards to thermoregulate in order to digest efficiently. We also hypothesized that food intake can influence behavioral thermoregulation via an interaction with water balance. Using a thermal gradient, we measured preferred ambient temperatures and total traveled distances of the lizard *T. catalanensis* in fed and fasted states, and also along a continuum of plasma osmolality. In contrast to the theory, our results show that food consumption does not affect preferred temperatures, plasma osmolality or the total traveled distances of lizards. Fed and non-fed lizards had the same thermal preferences. Moreover, food intake did not influence the preferred temperature of the lizards via an interaction with water balance. We believe that the extent of behavioral thermoregulation triggered by food consumption might be greater in species that feed on large prey, which can also lead to a cost of missed opportunity since the load associated with the consumption of a large meal can produce a decrement in the locomotor performance of the animals. Further investigations on the effects of meal size on behavioral thermoregulation, water balance and locomotor performance are necessary to better understand selection pressures influencing decision-making in lizards.
