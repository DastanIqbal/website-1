The oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) hypothesis has been proposed to explain thermal performance curves of animals by integrating various mechanisms from most levels of biological organization into a larger context of animal evolution. According to the OCLTT hypothesis, aerobic scope is typically presented as a curve with a maximum value close to the preferred body temperature and progressive declines in scope as temperature approaches upper or lower Tcrit. These reductions in scope are ascribed to progressive failure of the cardiorespiratory systems, and the OCLTT hypothesis therefore implies that as temperatures deviate from Topt, heart rates, gill ventilation rates, as well hemolymph oxygen levels are reduced. 

Master's student Jon Vimmerstedst is testing the OCLTT in embryos of *Coturnyx coturnyx*. One of his prediction is that environmental oxygen availability (hypoxia) should depress thermal limits. It has been an interesting experience to work with Jon, I've learnt a lot!. Below I show some pictures of the experimental work we are doing currently.
