I am heading Arizona, US, next week in order to do an internship at the Arizona State University (ASU). I'll be conducting a research project supervised by professor Michael Angilletta. To be brief, we are going to evaluate the effect of hypoxia on the thermal tolerance of lizards, so we are going to do some fieldwork combined with lab experiments. So excited to have this opportunity. Some pictures coming soon!


Update:

As I promised, here are some pictures of the ASU and surrounders:

The ASU - Tempe Campus is located in a small city called Tempe, which is also known as Hayden's Ferry during the territorial times of Arizona, is a city in Maricopa County, Arizona, United States. Tempe is located in the East Valley section of Phoenix; it is bordered by Phoenix and Guadalupe on the west, Scottsdale on the north, Chandler on the south, and Mesa on the east. Boy!, it is a really nice place with perfect weather conditions, good restaurants, bars and it is also one of the best places for an herpetologist. The city was built in the middle of the desert, so you can find a great variety of reptiles like the rattlesnakes, the gila monsters, etc. It is the BEST place, definitely!! 

The energetic environment of the campus comprises broad pedestrian malls and eclectic architecture set amid subtropical landscaping. Landmarks include the iconic, century-old Palm Walk:

Inside the Memorial Union you can find some good restaurants:

There are probably thousands of scooters around the city for short-distance transportation:

The Tempe campus is the most solar-powered of any in the U.S., and offers easy access to all of metropolitan Phoenix through public transit including light rail:

In the next post I'll show you the research work we are conducting at Michael Angilletta's lab.
