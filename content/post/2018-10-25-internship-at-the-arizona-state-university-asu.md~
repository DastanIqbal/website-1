I am heading Arizona, US, next week in order to do an internship at the Arizona State University (ASU). I'll be conducting a research project supervised by professor Michael Angilletta. To be brief, we are going to evaluate the effect of hypoxia on the thermal tolerance of lizards, so we are going to do some fieldwork combined with lab experiments. So excited to have this opportunity. Some pictures coming soon!
