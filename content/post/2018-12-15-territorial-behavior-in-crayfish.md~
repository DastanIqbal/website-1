Animals routinely fight with conspecifics to resolve territorial disputes. For organisms that possess specialized structures that function as weapons, fighting performance depends strongly on the ability of these structures to inflict injuries on rival combatants. However, aggressive interactions between animals are potentially costly because of the energy required to fight and the risk of injury or death. Because of the inherent costs associated with escalating aggressive interactions, many animals resolve disputes without combat by signaling their own fighting potential and comparing this with the potential of their opponent.

Theory predicts that animals should employ honest signals of resource holding potential during competitive interactions unless the cost of assessing the honesty of a signal is relatively great and the cost of producing a deceptive signal is relatively small. Signals of weaponry or potential strength should be physically or physiologically linked to competitive ability such that poor competitors cannot produce a signal equivalent to that of a good competitor. Not surprisingly, few clear examples of dishonest signals of fighting potential exist. Because dishonest signals are designed to go unnoticed, their detection is difficult for researchers and conspecifics alike. Assessing the honesty of signals requires (1) analyses of the relationship between the visual signal and fighting capacity and (2) measures of the physical performance of the displayed weaponry.

Doctoral student Zack Graham is highly interested in the above topic and is conducting several experiments on the crayfish with my help at Michael Angilletta's lab. One of the objective of his work is to test whether body size of a non-native Crayfish in Arizona is a reliable signal of the strength. You can see below an interesting video of what we are doing right now. I am so excited to be learning from Zack's research and can't wait to see the final results.
