I am currently working at the [Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute - Panama](https://stri.si.edu) (STRI) on a really interesting long-term project lead by [Mike Logan](http://www.evolutioninthetropics.com), [Christian Cox](http://www.coxevolab.org) and [Owen McMillan](https://stri.si.edu/scientist/owen-mcmillan). I was hired as an Intern to help them with a variety of activities, including lizard gathering, thermal tolerance experiments, data processing and statistical analyses. 

This research project aims to use genome-wide-association studies to identify genetic loci underlying variation in the thermal physiology 
of the slender anole lizard *Anolis apletophallus* (see pictures below), and to track changes in the frequencies of these loci in populations transplanted to islands in the Panama Canal. These islands vary in their thermal landscapes (see pictures below) such that some are much warmer than the mainland whereas others are similar in temperature to the mainland. To date, they have transplanted 700 individuals to 10 islands in Gatun Lake and this season we are transplanting lizards into another six islands. By conducting mark-recapture on the experimental islands, we will link phenotypic selection with genetic changes in real time, using the recently sequenced genome of *A. apletophallus* to explore the functional roles of specific genes under selection. After several generations of evolution, this project will use population pedigrees to estimate the genetic correlations and heritabilities underlying traits involved in thermal adaptation and model the long-term evolutionary response of the slender anole to climate change. 

It has been a great experince to be able to work with such a good team!


One of the coolest part of this project is the transplanting experiments. Every time we have to go to the islands we hop on a 20 min boat trip to Barro Colorado Island (BCI), in which STRI has a research station and provides us with a boat to do our work. Below you can see some pictures of BCI (and John David Curlis [JDC] and me on a boat).

As mentioned above, we are conducting thermal tolerance experiments with the lizards. That is, we are interested in determining the preferred body temperature, but also the upper and lower thermal voluntary limits of the lizards. Furthermore, we are quantifying dewlap, dorsal and ventral reflectance of the lizard since these are traits that can change over the time as they are introduced in novel environments (i.e., islands). Below I show some pictures of thermal gradients (upper left), JDC and Cleo Falvey measuring dewlap reflectance (upper right), me calculating the area of the dewlap's yellow patch of an individual (lower left) and lizard clay models to investigate predation rates on mainland as well as on islands (lower right).

Below are a couple of pictures of me holding two of the most interesting lizards we have found during field work. On the left I have a Bridled Anole *Anolis frenatus* and on the right I have a Smooth Helmeted Iguana *Corytophanes cristatus*.

And this is the lizard team for this season (2019) in Gamboa!
